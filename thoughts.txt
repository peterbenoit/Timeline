make a modern version of a this vertical timeline based on what is found in original.html and original.css

should be responsive (this will exist in a Bootstrap 5 template if that helps)

might could be a OL instead of UL, since a timeline denotes order; you choose based on semantic significance

don't use original html or css, no matching classes or anything; ONLY re-use the content

ignore the attempts folder, these aren't working right

css should be wrapped in a way similar to original.css

would be nice if elements alternated by default, unless specified by a classname to be on the left or right

do not us JS

the timeline should have a line down the middle, separating the left and right timeline items

the dots for each item should line up on this line

again, do not directly use HTML or CSS from existing. I want something new and useful

add 5 timeline items in the list so I can test them, use the original timeline item content as much as you can

create a full HTML document and link to the CSS you create

REMEMBER: this is a vertical timeline

Try not to let it look boostrappy
