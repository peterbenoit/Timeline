                                CDC publishes the first of a series of technical guidance documents,
                                data standards, and implementation guides, including guides for

                                CDC begins onboarding jurisdictions to send case notification data
                                using HL7 message mapping guides. By the end of the year, 10
                                jurisdictions are routinely sending production data for at least one
                                condition.
